# 🧠 Useless Stats

Welcome to my website about **Useless Stats**, the most unnecessary repository of facts you never asked for but now can’t un-know. This site serves up wonderfully pointless data—because sometimes, that's exactly what the internet needs.

## 🎯 What Is This?

A collection of useless stats that nobody asked for.
If you're looking for meaningful insight... you've wandered into the wrong corner of GitHub. But if you enjoy trivia, pull up a chair.

## 🧩 How It Works

This website was built with love, sarcasm, and a refusal to take data too seriously. It uses:
- HTML / CSS / JS
- Pure passion for pointless numbers
- Contributions from internet wanderers like yourself 🕶️

## 📜 License

This project is licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE). Feel free to use, remix, and share—with proper attribution, of course. Spread the nonsense!

## 💬 Shout-Outs

Inspired by the beautiful chaos that is the human internet.
